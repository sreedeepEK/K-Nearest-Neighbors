# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch

### Introduction

This project is designed to a clear understanding of how the KNN algorithm works by walking through the code step by step.

KNN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The idea is straightforward: given a new data point, KNN finds the 'K' nearest neighbors in the training data and makes a prediction based on their labels or values.

## How It Works

1. **Calculate Distances:** For a given data point, calculate the Euclidean distance to all other points in the training set.
2. **Find Neighbors:** Identify the 'K' closest data points (neighbors).
3. **Make Prediction:** For classification, the most common label among the neighbors is chosen. For regression, the average value is used.

## Installation

To get started with the project, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/K-Nearest-Neighbour.git
